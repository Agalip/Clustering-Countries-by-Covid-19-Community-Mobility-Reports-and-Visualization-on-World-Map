# Clustering Countries by Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports and Visualization on World Map

## Introduction

This study aims to cluster countries and find a possible relationship by examining the mobility data of countries during the covid period. This relationship may be geographical, cultural, religious or so.
Plotting these clusters on the world map will help us find out whether there is a relationship, and if so, what kind of relationship it is.
